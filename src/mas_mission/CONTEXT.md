# mas_mission

## Purpose
Mission state management and command routing for multi-agent systems. State-gated command multiplexer — routes gimbal/zoom/velocity commands from the active source (tracking or policy) based on the current mission state.

## Nodes

### mission_node
**File:** `mas_mission/mission_node.py`
**Pattern:** Subscriber-driven (command passthrough gated by state, heartbeat timer for state publishing)

#### State Machine
```
IDLE (0)  — no commands forwarded
TRACKING (1) — gimbal tracking commands forwarded
MISSION (2)  — full policy commands forwarded (cmd_vel, gimbal, zoom)
HOVER_CMD (3) — nothing forwarded (offboard holds current position)
WAYPOINT (4)  — nothing forwarded (offboard returns to configured waypoint)
```
All transitions triggered by operator via `/mission_state_cmd` topic. HOVER_CMD and WAYPOINT behave like IDLE from the mission node's perspective (no commands forwarded); the distinction is consumed by `mas_offboard`.

#### Subscriptions
- `/mission_state_cmd` (`std_msgs/Int8`) — operator command (global topic, RELIABLE + transient local)
- `policy/cmd_vel` (`geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`) — policy velocity command (MISSION state)
- `policy/gimbal_cmd_los_rate` (`geometry_msgs/Vector3`) — policy gimbal rate command (MISSION state)
- `policy/zoom_rate_cmd` (`std_msgs/Float32`) — policy zoom rate command (MISSION state)
- `tracking/gimbal_cmd_los_world_deg` (`geometry_msgs/Vector3`) — tracking gimbal world-frame az/el command (TRACKING state)
- `tracking/zoom_rate_cmd` (`std_msgs/Float32`) — tracking zoom rate command (TRACKING state)

#### Publishers
- `mission_state` (`std_msgs/Int8`) — current state enum (RELIABLE + transient local, heartbeat at 1 Hz)
- `cmd_vel` (`geometry_msgs/TwistStamped`) — gated velocity command → mas_offboard
- `gimbal_cmd_los_world_deg` (`geometry_msgs/Vector3`) — gated gimbal world-frame az/el command → los_rate_controller
- `gimbal_cmd_los_rate` (`geometry_msgs/Vector3`) — gated gimbal LOS rate command → gimbal node
- `zoom_rate_cmd` (`std_msgs/Float32`) — gated zoom rate command → los_rate_controller / siyi_gimbal_node

#### Parameters
- `heartbeat_rate_hz` (`double`, default: `1.0`) — mission_state heartbeat publish rate
- `initial_state` (`int`, default: `0`) — initial mission state (IDLE)

#### Dependencies
- mas_policy — provides policy commands (MISSION state)
- gimbal_controller/point_to_region_node — provides tracking commands (TRACKING state)
- mas_offboard — consumes cmd_vel and mission_state
